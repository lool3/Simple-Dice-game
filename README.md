# Simple-Dice-game
### A simple dice game made with python.

## THIS PROJECT IS ARCHIVED/ABANDONED. I WILL NO LONGER BE MAINTAINING OR UPDATING THIS PROJECT AS OF 22/06/2022. ##

I made most of this while in school, and later forked it to repl.it and now, I'm finally moving my projects to github.

At school, we were all given the task to create a simple dice game that requires the player to sign in.
This project was my attempt to create an overengineered solution.

Features:
- Very simple dice game
- SQLite database that stores **hashed** login details
- Password length and quality checker

Yet to be implemented:
- Password entropy calculator
